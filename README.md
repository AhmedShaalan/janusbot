# Janus Bot ðŸ¤–

Basic implementation for using Slack Developer Kit for Node.js.
Started the project to build an attendance bot. But then I found it helpful for others to see the code.

# How to get started

* Create a file and name it `slack-token` and add your slack token there.
* Run `npm start`
* Done! you should receive a message every minute on your workspace

# What is included
